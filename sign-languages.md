## Introduction

Sign languages use hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and body positions to convey meaning.

For most people who are Deaf, sign language is their native language. Some do not read or understand written language well &mdash; especially at the speed of most captions.

Not everyone who is Deaf knows sign languages, especially if they became Deaf later in life.

There are different sign languages in different regions and countries; for example, American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Auslan (Australian Sign Language) are all different.

## Standards Requirements

Most minimum accessibility standards do not require sign language; some do.

Sign language is in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at Level AAA.

## Skills and Tools

To include sign language alternatives, you will need people, skills, and tools to:
* do the sign language interpretation
* record it
* edit it in/with the audio or video file

## Creating Sign Language Alternatives

There are resources on the web that provide guidance on creating sign language alternatives. For example:
* [Sign Language Interpretation in HBBTV (PDF)](http://pagines.uab.cat/hbb4all/sites/pagines.uab.cat.hbb4all/files/sign_language_interpreting_in_hbbtv.pdf) includes specific guidance on aspects such as:
* sign language interpreters
* filming the signing
* position of the sign language
* Guidelines for the Production of Signing Books:
	*  [Sign language presentation](http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/signingbooks/deliver/d31/deliv_31_part3-2.html#3.2.2.6)
	* [Filming the Signers](http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/signingbooks/sbrc/grid/d71/guide12.htm)
	*  [Editing](http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/signingbooks/sbrc/grid/d71/guide13.htm)
